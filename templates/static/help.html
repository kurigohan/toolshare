								A shed is a place in which a user can store tools or borrow tools.
								Each share zone has at least one shed. When a user creates an account
								their home is a representative shed. A shed is a physical location that a user
								can go to in order to receive their borrowed tools.

						<tr>
							<td class="text-muted label-col">What happens when I borrow?</td>
							<td>
								By borrowing you request from another user a specific tool they own.
								If they approve you, then you can go to the shed that holds that tool
								or the user home and receive it. If they do not approve you, then the tool remains with
								the owner. At the end of a specific time period you must return the tool
								to the shed or owner of the tool.
