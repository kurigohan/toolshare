                A shed is a place where a user can share tools or borrow tools.
                Each share zone has at least one shed. A shed is also a physical location that a user
                can go to in order to pickup borrowed tools.

                <td class="text-muted label-col">What is a home shed?</td>
                <td>
                Every user has a home shed. The zip code of your home shed determines your share zone.
                You will always have a home shed,  
                By default a home shed is created for you at registration, but you can set any of your sheds as a 
                home shed.   Your designated home shed cannot be deleted.

                <td class="text-muted label-col">What is share zone?</td>
                <td>
                The share zone is the area where you can find tools shared by other users who have the same zip code as you.
                You can only borrow a tool from within your share zone.

                <td>
                Once you have found an available tool you'd like to borrow in your share zone, you can select 'Send Borrow Request'.
                This will notify the tool's owner of your intent. It is up to the tool owner to approve or deny your borrow request.

                <td>
               The circled exclamation point at the top-left corner of this page will take you to your borrow request page.
                From there you can view, approve, or deny  borrow requests that were sent to you. You can also cancel any of the pending request you have sent.

                <td class="text-muted label-col">What is the difference between a shared tool and a loaned
                tool?</td>
                <td>
                A shared tool is a tool with no borrower; that is, a tool ready to share
                with any borrower. A loaned tool is currently on loan to some borrower.
                If you borrow a tool and return it, please hit the "Return" button on
                its description so others can see that it is available again.

                <td>
                The envelope icon on the top navigation bar will take you to your inbox. You can send other user's private messages from there.

                <td class="text-muted label-col">Why can't I delete my tool/shed?</td>
                <td>
                A tool cannot be deleted if it is currently being borrowed. A shed cannot be deleted if it is designated as the home shed or if it has any tools in it.
