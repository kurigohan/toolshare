Required:
	Django 1.6 +
	Python 2.7 +

--------GETTING STARTED--------

To Run:

	1. From the terminal, change to the toolshare directory
	2. If the directory does not contain a db.sqlite3 file for testing, create a new one - 'python manage.py syncdb'
	3. Start the dev server - 'python manage.py runserver'
	4. Enter the server ip in your web browser (default 127.0.0.1:8000) 

	**When creating a new database, if you create a superuser you cannot use that account to login to the main site. You must register a normal account to login to the toolshare site.

Reccomended browsers: Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox 

---------APP INFO----------

Toolshare pages:
	- Dashboard options:	
		1. My Tools - This page displays all your tools and tools borrowed.
		2. My Sheds - This page displays all your sheds. You will always have one shed designated as your 'home'. Your home shed is used to determine your share zone.
		3. Share zone - This page displays all tools within your share zone (zip code). You can only borrow tools from within your share zone. 

	- Top-bar Nav:
		1. Bell icon - Your notifications
		2. Mail Icon - Your inbox/outbox for private messaging
		3. Exclamation Icon - Your borrow requests

How borrowing and sharing works:
	- Users can only borrow tools that are in their share zone. When a user selects borrow, a borrow request is sent to the tool owner. The tool owner has the option to accept or deny the request.
